## Initial Core Pillars (Starter)

For Stapledon's Voyage, these are likely candidates based on the game vision:

### Candidate Pillar: Time Has Weight
Every journey is irreversible. Decades pass. The player must feel the cost of time.

### Candidate Pillar: No Cheap Saves
The game respects player choices by making them matter. No save-scumming the cosmic timeline.

### Candidate Pillar: Consequences, Not Punishment
The galaxy responds to player actions, but "bad" outcomes are still interesting outcomes.

### Candidate Pillar: Alien Minds Are Alien
Non-human civilizations think differently. Contact is not just transaction.

### Candidate Pillar: The Observer Changes the Observed
Your presence matters. Staying home vs. visiting creates different timelines.

*Note: These are suggestions. Actual pillars should emerge from vision interviews.*
