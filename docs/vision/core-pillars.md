# Core Pillars

These are non-negotiable design constraints for Stapledon's Voyage. Every feature must serve at least one.

## 1. Choices Are Final

**One-liner:** No saves, no reloads. Live with consequences or start fresh.

**This means:**
- Once a journey is committed, it cannot be undone
- The only way to explore different paths is a new playthrough
- This creates natural replayability ("What if I had gone there first?")
- Decisions have weight because they cannot be optimized away

**This excludes:**
- Save/load systems
- "Undo" mechanics
- Branching previews that let you see outcomes before committing

---

## 2. The Game Doesn't Judge

**One-liner:** Present consequences, not morals. Players find their own meaning.

**This means:**
- The legacy report shows facts: who lived, who died, what changed
- Players interpret whether outcomes are "good" or "bad"
- What's victory at one scale may be failure at another (personal vs planetary vs galactic)
- The game prompts philosophical questions, not answers

**This excludes:**
- "Good" and "bad" ending labels
- Moral scoring systems
- Lectures about player choices
- Obvious "correct" paths

---

## 3. Time Has Emotional Weight

**One-liner:** Time dilation means loss, isolation, and treasuring what remains.

**This means:**
- Every journey costs relationships outside the ship
- Civilizations age, change, forget you, or die while you travel
- The loneliness of being out of sync with the universe is felt, not just calculated
- This should make players think about their real relationships

**This excludes:**
- Time as just a resource to optimize
- Consequence-free fast travel
- "Pausing" the universe while you decide

---

## 4. The Ship Is Home

**One-liner:** Crew provides human-scale grounding against cosmic-scale alienation.

**This means:**
- The player is captain with agency, but crew have opinions and reactions
- Crew relationships are the one constant across the journey
- Inner space (ship) contrasts with outer space (universe): intimate vs vast
- Crew dialogue helps players process and reflect on cosmic events
- Relationships can strain or break (mutiny is possible if things go badly)

**This excludes:**
- Silent, personality-less crew
- Crew as purely mechanical resources
- Ship as just a vehicle

---

## 5. Grounded Strangeness

**One-liner:** Aliens are scientifically plausible but maximally diverse. Extensible.

**This means:**
- Each species starts from physically possible biology, philosophy, astrophysics
- Maximum diversity across the possibility space
- Modular design: species can be added over time
- Community-expandable: players and modders can create new species
- Drake equation and real science inform the number and distribution

**This excludes:**
- "Humans with funny faces" aliens
- Magic or physics-breaking species
- Closed, non-extensible species rosters
