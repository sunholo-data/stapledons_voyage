## 2025-11-29 Session: Core Pillars Extraction

**Focus:** Establishing the foundational design constraints for Stapledon's Voyage

### Q: When a player finishes and sees their legacy report, what should they feel?

**A:** All possible feelings depending on how the game went - triumph, melancholy, awe, moral weight. The emotional outcome is emergent from play, not prescribed.

### Q: Should the game ever tell players they did something 'wrong'?

**A:** No. The player judges. The game presents consequences. A philosophy game shouldn't make judgments - what's victory at one scale may be failure at another. The main lesson is that judgments are a matter of perspective.

### Q: How important is it that players can't undo their choices?

**A:** Essential. Players must live with decisions. Start a new game to try something else. This creates replayability.

### Q: What makes time dilation feel meaningful, not just a number?

**A:** The loneliness. Realizing how utterly inhuman traveling at speed and experiencing time dilation will be. Everyone you know dies or becomes indifferent. It should make players treasure their real-life moments with loved ones. The ship crew becomes precious as the one constant.

### Q: What's the player's relationship with their crew?

**A:** Player is protagonist/captain for agency. Crew offers opinions, represents inner feelings, can change based on events. Possible mutiny if things go badly. They help represent the inner feelings versus the outer space time-dilated experiences. Inner space vs outer space.

### Q: How alien should the aliens be?

**A:** As realistic as possible. Start from physically possible but maximally diverse starting points (philosophy, biology, astrophysics). Modular so more can be added over time. Community-expandable. This will be a rich source of content.

### Q: What's the irreducible core for MVP?

**A:** Time dilation loop with 100 years. Philosophical choices with multiple endings. Crew dialogue that guides and provokes thought. Limited but realistic species count (Drake equation). Year 1,000,000 fast-forward is great but could phase in.

### Insights

- The game is a philosophy prompt, not a philosophy lecture
- Time dilation is primarily an emotional mechanic, not a puzzle
- Ship crew serves as emotional anchor and moral sounding board
- Replayability comes from permanence, not saves
- Selfishness vs altruism; personal vs planetary vs galactic scale

### Actions

- [x] Establish 5 core pillars in docs/vision/core-pillars.md
- [ ] Create first design doc that references pillars
- [ ] Conduct follow-up interview on specific mechanics
