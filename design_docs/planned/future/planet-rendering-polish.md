## Game Vision Alignment

**Score this feature against Stapledon's Voyage core pillars:**

| Pillar | Relevance | Score | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Time Dilation Consequence | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does this reinforce irreversible time choices?] |
| Civilization Simulation | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does it enhance galaxy-scale simulation?] |
| Philosophical Depth | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does it add moral/philosophical decisions?] |
| Ship & Crew Life | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does it connect to finite crew narrative?] |
| Legacy Impact | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does it contribute to Year 1,000,000 report?] |
| Hard Sci-Fi Authenticity | [+/0/−/N/A] | [+1/0/−1] | [Does it maintain scientific plausibility?] |
| **Net Score** | | **[Total]** | **Decision: [Move forward / Reject / Redesign]** |

**Feature type:** [Gameplay / Engine / Infrastructure]
- **Gameplay**: Direct player-facing features → should score positively on multiple pillars
- **Engine/Infrastructure**: Enabling tech → N/A is acceptable, no negative scores
