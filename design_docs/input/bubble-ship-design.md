A 100 m radius bubble with ~100 people is totally plausible as a self-sustaining micro-civilization, and it gives you a ton of room for game systems.

Let’s quantify and then sketch how the whole thing hangs together.

⸻

1. Scale check: what does a 100 m radius bubble actually give you?

Sphere, radius r = 100 m:
	•	Volume ≈ 4/3 π r³ ≈ 4.2 million m³
	•	Inner surface area ≈ 4 π r² ≈ 125,000 m²

For 100 people:
	•	That’s 42,000 m³ per person – absurdly generous.
	•	Even if only ~10–20% of the volume is “habitat/usable”, you’re still way beyond any realistic life-support requirement.
	•	Agricultural area: with vertical hydroponics you can get by on ~10–50 m² of crop area per person. For 100 people, that’s 1,000–5,000 m² – a tiny fraction of your 125,000 m² inner surface.

So in hard-sci terms, a 100 m radius bubble is easily enough to:
	•	sustain 100 crew indefinitely,
	•	host a meaningful ecological system,
	•	and leave huge spare volume for labs, alien tech, and weird future structures.

It’s not just “enough”; it’s luxurious.

⸻

2. Structural layout: ship + bubble + room to grow

The clean mental model is nested cores:
	1.	Bubble Generator Core (center, ~10–15 m radius)
	•	Higgs-displacement machinery
	•	Inertial control systems
	•	Navigation + photon drive coupling points
	•	High-radiation, highly shielded region – no civilians
	2.	Engineering & Power Torus (say 15–30 m radius)
	•	Fusion reactors (primary)
	•	Fission reactors (bootstrap, backup, isotope production)
	•	Heat exchangers and radiator feed lines
	•	Reaction mass / photon emission structures anchored here
	3.	Habitat Ring(s) (30–60 m radius)
	•	Crew quarters, common areas, med bay, workshops
	•	Archive core + data centers
	•	Control rooms for flight/comms
	•	Potentially arranged as stacked rings so your isometric “ship map” has multiple levels.
	4.	Agri + Biome Shell (60–90 m radius)
	•	Hydroponic decks, algae vats, orchards, microbial processing
	•	“Park forest” / psychological green spaces
	•	Experimental ecologies (useful for alien bio-integration later)
	5.	Outer Tech / Expansion Shell (90–100 m radius)
	•	Reserved for:
	•	alien tech modules you bolt on later
	•	specialized labs (GR experiment labs, exotic matter containment)
	•	observation galleries with huge viewports
	•	Start the game with this relatively empty; let it “fill in” as you collect proto-tech and upgrade the ship.

Visually and in-game, this gives you:
	•	A compact core (feels like a ship)
	•	Surrounded by an expanding “bubble city” that grows as the campaign progresses.

⸻

3. Power: fission, fusion, and the bubble’s weird physics

You probably want a layered power strategy:
	1.	Fission
	•	Startup power, isotope production, redundancy.
	•	Small mass footprint; good for emergencies.
	•	Fine to say you left Earth with a multi-century nuclear inventory.
	2.	Fusion
	•	Main workhorse for deep space and high thrust.
	•	Deuterium + He-3 or D–D, depending on how hard-sci you go.
	•	Fuel stockpiled at launch + occasional refueling by:
	•	skimming stellar winds,
	•	capturing interstellar medium,
	•	grazing gas giants’ upper atmospheres if your bubble field can be momentarily modulated.
	3.	Radiative Harvest
	•	You’re transparent to photons.
	•	You can literally treat the inner surface as one gigantic PV array / photoelectric collector when in high-flux regimes:
	•	close solar passes,
	•	BH accretion disks,
	•	supernova remnants.
	•	That gives a nice mechanic: “run close to the fire” for big power spikes at GR risk.

You don’t need to explain every watt; just be consistent:
	•	Fission for base load & redundancy
	•	Fusion for thrust & heavy processing
	•	Radiative harvest as environmental bonus

⸻

4. Mass balance: neutrinos vs more sane options

“With mass exchange limits so low we may want to constantly harvest any mass we can get (neutrinos?)”

For hard sci:
	•	Neutrinos are a terrible mass source.
Flux is huge, but cross-sections are so small that even planetary detectors barely see them. Turning neutrino flux into usable mass at any reasonable rate would be wildly beyond even your already-magic tech.

What does make sense in-fiction:
	1.	Treat the bubble as essentially mass-conserving.
	•	You left Earth with enough structural mass, water, nitrogen, carbon, metals to last millennia.
	•	Almost perfect recycling internally.
	•	You don’t need to gain much mass; you just need to not lose it.
	2.	Trickle-feed mass from external environment via tuned field.
	•	The “mass limit” at the boundary is not a hard zero; it’s a function of energy/momentum/particle type.
	•	You can tune it to:
	•	let through individual atoms/ions,
	•	small amounts of interstellar gas and dust,
	•	solar wind particles.
This is physically far more plausible: over centuries, at relativistic speeds:
	•	a scoop cross-section of ~π(100 m)² is large enough to intersect a fair amount of ISM, especially in denser regions (molecular clouds, protoplanetary disks, cometary tails).
	3.	Gameplay interpretation:
	•	You can top up:
	•	hydrogen for fusion,
	•	trace elements for replacement and manufacturing,
	•	but you cannot radically increase your total mass budget.
	•	So “mass scarcity” is more about high-spec exotic materials than bulk stuff.

If you want a fun but still “hardish” hook:
have one exotic mass channel allowed, with strict throughput limits (e.g. special nanostructures designed to cross the boundary by staging mass in femtogram units). That lets you narratively justify occasional import/export of tiny physical artifacts that still matter (e.g. seeds, nanotech, single alien organoids).

⸻

5. Gravity & decks

With a 100 m radius:
	•	You can absolutely use continuous 1 g acceleration for long stretches:
	•	Engines at one side, decks “stacked” along the acceleration vector.
	•	When you flip and decelerate, everyone walks the other way “up”.

Or, if you want more consistent layout:
	•	Combine:
	•	always-on low thrust (for bias), plus
	•	local spin rings for areas where “gravity” is needed independent of thrust.

But since you already like the “acceleration = gravity” idea, just align the interior design with that:
	•	“Down” is always “towards the engine stack,”
	•	The bubble generator + power torus are “below”,
	•	Upper decks are closer to the forward side.

The 100 m radius gives you plenty of vertical headroom to make the “tower ship inside bubble” very visually readable in an isometric or cutaway map.

⸻

6. In-game implications & hooks
	•	100 people is enough for:
	•	multi-generational drama,
	•	factions,
	•	emergent culture,
	•	believable skill diversity (pilots, engineers, biologists, artists, Archive priests…).
	•	100 m radius bubble is:
	•	physically respectable for self-sustaining life support,
	•	big enough to feel like a small town,
	•	small enough to still feel trapped.
	•	Bubble extends beyond current ship structures:
	•	Start the game with a relatively modest “spine + ring” ship in the middle.
	•	As you gather alien tech & solve proto-tech quests, you grow into the outer volume:
	•	new labs,
	•	alien-inspired biomes,
	•	exotic-material radiators,
	•	Archive expansion nodes,
	•	maybe even a “garden cathedral” at the outer shell where crew go to look at the stars.

That gives you a beautiful visual metaphor:

as your knowledge and responsibility grow, the inhabited radius of the bubble grows too.

Absolutely — here are visual concept sketches laid out as clean, top-down structural diagrams you can hand to artists, UI/UX, or AILANG-engine implementers.
Since I can’t upload hand-drawn art, I’m giving you diagrammatic sketches + accompanying image groups using search queries that match the intended look (cutaway spheres, O’Neill-style interiors, multideck sci-fi hulls). These should provide strong visual grounding.

This sketch is canonical for design implementation.

Great question — and you didn’t misunderstand. I did describe a scenario where the bubble can be transparent to light, but let’s examine whether that is:
	1.	Physically plausible (within our “Higgs bubble” fiction),
	2.	Desirable for gameplay,
	3.	Consistent with the constraints we’ve already built.

Let’s break it down cleanly.

⸻

⭐ 1. What would a real Higgs-negation bubble do to light?

If the Higgs field were suppressed inside a region of space:
	•	Massive particles lose mass → can’t cross the boundary normally.
	•	Photons, being massless, don’t get mass from the Higgs field anyway → their propagation is not directly affected by turning the Higgs field off.

This means light can cross the bubble boundary freely unless additional field effects (refractive index, QED coupling, vacuum structure) are introduced.

So yes, in a simple Higgs-negation model:

✔ Light passes through the bubble boundary

✔ EM radiation passes through

✔ Information can enter and exit normally

✔ Macroscopic matter cannot cross

This gives us:
	•	perfect windows anywhere on the bubble,
	•	beautiful starfield views,
	•	and a clean explanation for communication with civilizations.

So transparency is not only plausible but natural in this fictional physics.

⸻

⭐ 2. Should the bubble be visually transparent from inside? Yes.

From inside, you absolutely want:
	•	constant view of stars
	•	ability to watch relativistic effects
	•	cinematics when passing planets
	•	emotional beats (crew staring out at Earth)

This is very high-value for UI, art direction, and the “feeling small in the universe” theme.

⸻

⭐ 3. Should the bubble be visually transparent from outside?

Here we get two options.

Option A — Transparent from both sides (clean physics).

Light just goes in and out like a soap bubble.

Pros:
	•	simplest explanation
	•	matches Higgs-negation physics
	•	aliens can see you, though they cannot touch you
	•	the ship looks like a floating sphere with a ship inside

Cons:
	•	predators/hostile civs can watch you easily
	•	no stealth
	•	less mystery

Option B — One-way transparency (physically hacky, but allowed).

You can see out, but outsiders see only:
	•	distorted light,
	•	a reflective shell,
	•	or an opaque “mirage”.

This requires additional handwaving such as:
	•	boundary refraction,
	•	vacuum polarization,
	•	scattering shell,
	•	exotic photonic interference.

Pros:
	•	makes you mythic to civilizations
	•	they see a shimmering apparition
	•	reinforces the “untouchable visitors” mythology

Cons:
	•	more complex fictionally
	•	less raw beauty when viewed from outside (though players rarely see the outside perspective anyway)

My recommendation:

✔ Transparent from inside

✔ Visually distorted from outside (but not opaque)

So outsiders see:
	•	a shimmering gravitational lens effect,
	•	like heat haze on water,
	•	faint reflections,
	•	distorted interior shapes but no crisp details.

This is very “Stapledonian” — an observer would know something is there, but not its exact geometry.

It maintains:
	•	the mystery
	•	the sense of elevated physics
	•	the thematic fact that nobody can touch you

And it’s easy for artists to depict.

⸻

⭐ 4. Gameplay implications of transparency

Inside the bubble:
	•	You have 360° panorama of space → ideal for dynamic background visuals.
	•	You see relativistic starfields as you accelerate → beautiful sequences.
	•	GR lensing near black holes becomes a major spectacle.

Outside the bubble:
Civilizations see:

✔ a shimmering sphere

✔ sometimes glowing

✔ sometimes invisible except at grazing angles

✔ occasionally exhibiting Cherenkov-like distortions

✔ sometimes temporarily opaque during extreme maneuvers or GR exposure

This reinforces the “visiting angel / myth” archetype.

⸻

⭐ 5. The real physics analogy: refractive boundary

More than Higgs suppression, what you’ve described matches:

A coherent region with different vacuum refractive index.

This naturally produces:
	•	lensing
	•	distortion
	•	transparency
	•	no mass exchange
	•	no inertia crossing

This is extremely believable sci-fi physics.

⸻

⭐ 6. The canonical rule (write this into the design doc):

THE BUBBLE SHELL IS OPTICALLY PERMEABLE BUT REFRACTIVE.
	•	Light passes freely.
	•	Observers can see inside, but imperfectly.
	•	The boundary slightly bends, magnifies, or compresses incoming light.
	•	The appearance shifts depending on external radiation, EM fields, and relativistic velocity.

This keeps things hard-sci, cinematic, and thematically rich.

⸻

⭐ 7. TL;DR — Did you misunderstand?

No.
Transparency is correct and physically justified here.
We only add a touch of refraction if we want stylistic flair.

Perfect — let’s formalize the internal geometry of the bubble so your isometric layout, camera angles, and physics all align.

You already intuit the correct arrangement:
	•	Down = toward engines
	•	Up = toward navigation / piloting deck
	•	Center = Higgs Generator Spire
	•	Layers = concentric shells and stacked decks
	•	Outer boundary = transparent bubble showing SR/GR effects

Below is a clean canonical design of the interior architecture.

⸻

⭐ 1. THE INTERNAL AXIS OF THE BUBBLE

Think of the bubble as having a vertical axis through its center:

TOP (Forward) → Piloting Deck / Observation Crown
CENTER       → Higgs Spire (fixed)
BOTTOM       → Engine / Power Stack (aft)

Or using game terms:
	•	Up = “forward” (direction of travel)
	•	Down = “aft” (engine thrust direction)

This means all interior decks have gravity generated by acceleration pointing toward engines (down).

⸻

⭐ 2. THE HIGGS GENERATOR SPIRE (THE CENTRAL COLUMN)

You asked what the “spire” is — here is the formal definition:

✔ It is the structural and functional core of the bubble ship

✔ It anchors the inertial field

✔ It contains the Higgs-shell generator rings

✔ It supports the photon-drive interface

✔ It is the reason the bubble is spherical and stable

✔ It is the “forbidden zone” (crew cannot enter)

You can picture it like a vertical tower/cylinder passing through the center of the sphere.

Geometry of the Spire

       (Pilot Deck)
           |
           |
     [Upper Spire: Navigation Field Lattice]
           |
     [Core Spire: Higgs Displacement Engine]
           |
     [Lower Spire: Thrust & Photon Emitters]
           |
      (Engine Deck)

	•	Rough height: 150–180 meters (runs nearly entire diameter)
	•	Diameter: 20–30 m core cylinder
	•	Shielded layers inside (reactor-grade containment)
	•	Surrounding decks built in rings around it

This makes the spire functionally:
	1.	A keel (structural)
	2.	A reactor column (power)
	3.	A metric-engine shaft (bubble generation)
	4.	A narrative relic (origin of your amnesia)

You can reveal deeper secrets of the spire in late game (e.g., remnants from previous universes).

⸻

⭐ 3. TOP DECK: PILOTING & COMMAND OBSERVATORY

This is the crown jewel for cool SR/GR visuals.

Location:

At the very top of the sphere, directly above the spire.

Function:
	•	Navigation
	•	Visual starfield
	•	SR aberration simulation
	•	GR lensing effects when near massive objects
	•	Dialogue scenes with crew/A.I. overlooking the void

Visual framing:
	•	Horizonless cosmic dome
	•	Transparent bubble as ceiling
	•	Slight refractive distortions
	•	Parallax shifts visible as you change direction
	•	Blueshift/Redshift gradients shown in starfield

Isometric presentation:
	•	The pilot deck is at the top of vertical layout
	•	Exterior cosmos is visible behind the isometric walls
	•	As player moves down floors, view gradually transitions from “cosmic panorama” to “internal architecture”

⸻

⭐ 4. LAYERING OF THE SHIP: ISOMETRIC-FRIENDLY DESIGN

Your interior is multi-level, but not cramped because:
	•	100 m radius = very tall vertical space
	•	Ceilings can be 5–10 m high (majestic)
	•	Decks can be spaced with huge volumes between them

Here’s a canonical deck structure (vertical):

  |           1. Observation / Bridge       |
  |           (full cosmic panoramic dome)  |
  +-----------------------------------------+

  |   Light machinery levels around upper spire  |
  |   (Navigation field rings, sensor arrays)    |

Each layer gets appropriate outside view:
	•	Upper decks: open space, galaxy view
	•	Mid decks: partial views with ship structure intruding
	•	Lower decks: engines glowing, relativistic exhaust cone visuals

Perfect for isometric parallax.

⭐ 5. HOW THE VIEW CHANGES BY LEVEL (SR EFFECTS)

TOP LEVEL — Bridge
	•	Strongest aberration
	•	Starfield compressed into forward cone
	•	Doppler colour shifts
	•	Bubble refractive distortions subtle but present
	•	Brightness adjustments based on velocity

MID LEVELS — Habitat
	•	Views framed by internal structure
	•	Less direct SR lensing (angle of viewing slightly off-forward)
	•	Reflection of interior lighting on bubble surface

AGRI LEVELS
	•	Light plays off water droplets, plant leaves
	•	Starfield shimmers through canopy
	•	Crew can “stargaze from a forest inside a bubble” — very poetic

ENGINEERING LEVELS
	•	Strong bloom from drive emissions
	•	Glancing angle reveals gravitational shear (if near massive bodies)
	•	Bubble refracts engine light in beautiful patterns

This creates a dynamic visual gradient as the player walks down levels.

⭐ 6. WHERE EXACTLY THE HIGGS GENERATOR SITS

✔ It is not on a floor

✔ It is suspended through all floors

✔ Floors “wrap around” it in rings

Picture a lighthouse or cathedral tower that continues through multiple architecture layers.

From the outside looking in, the spire is the vertical spine of the entire habitat.

From inside:
	•	You see sections of it through reinforced windows
	•	Crew talk about it with awe
	•	Archive has restricted access commands for it
	•	Strange vibrations or distortions occasionally emanate (story triggers)

It is the heart of the ship.

⸻

⭐ 7. Why This Layout Is Perfect For Your Game

✔ Great isometric readability

Multiple layers, recognizable silhouettes, rich parallax backgrounds.

✔ Constant cosmic presence

Even deep inside the ship, the outside light subtly penetrates.

✔ Psychological storytelling

Crew always feel suspended in a bubble in an uncaring universe — perfect for philosophical arcs.

✔ Spatial drama

The spire itself becomes a character.

✔ Supports gameplay progression

You can unlock new decks, expand into unused volume, or attach alien-tech modules around the interior perimeter.

In our Higgs-bubble model, the bubble itself is the pressure hull.

1. Does the bubble hold the air in?

Yes, if we stick to the fiction we’ve been building:
	•	The Higgs bubble boundary blocks massive particles from crossing.
	•	Gas molecules are massive → they cannot leave.
	•	Photons and EM can cross freely → you still see out, communicate, etc.

So physically:
	•	You can fill the entire 100 m radius bubble with air at 1 bar.
	•	There is no risk of “hull breach to vacuum” in the classic SF sense, because there is no vacuum outside in the relevant sense: the field boundary is the seal.

Think of the bubble as an invisible, indestructible, spherical pressure vessel.

You still need structure (floors, trusses, decks) so people aren’t just floating and so you can mount equipment, but you don’t need a metal hull to keep atmosphere in.

⸻

2. Do we still want internal “walls” and compartments?

Mechanically and narratively: yes, but for different reasons:
	•	Fire / contamination control:
You still want to be able to isolate a lab that released toxins, a reactor bay on fire, etc.
	•	Different atmospheres:
	•	You might want:
	•	high-O₂ greenhouse zones,
	•	low-O₂ engineering zones (fire suppression),
	•	alien-atmosphere wetlabs.
	•	Those need internal membranes/pressure doors even if the outer bubble holds everything.
	•	Psychological and social spaces:
	•	People like rooms, corridors, “places”.
	•	For your isometric levels, you want visually distinct areas, not a single open airsphere.

So:
	•	Outer boundary (Higgs shell) = ultimate, unbreachable pressure hull.
	•	Inner walls/bulkheads = for zoning, safety, and gameplay control.

But you don’t need a continuous inner metal hull; you can have lots of open atria, big caverns, forest domes, etc., without worrying about “puncturing the ship.”

⸻

3. Canonical behavior for leaks / damage

For the fiction and mechanics:
	•	A “hole in a wall” just equalizes pressure within the bubble; nothing is lost outside.
	•	Massive particles (air, dust, people) hit the bubble boundary and bounce / diffuse; they do not escape.
	•	Catastrophic external impacts are handled by the field:
	•	Micrometeoroids, debris, etc., never enter; they’re diverted or shredded at the boundary.

So your big disasters are:
	•	internal: fire, toxins, fights, reactor issues, AI glitches, psychological breakdowns;
	•	not: “a rock punched a hole and everyone got sucked out.”

That simplifies survival logic and matches the “indestructible prison-habitat” theme.

⸻

4. Recommended canonical statement for the GDD

Something like:

“The Higgs bubble’s field boundary is impermeable to massive particles but transparent to light and EM.
It acts as a perfect pressure hull: atmosphere cannot leak out, and vacuum cannot leak in.
Internal walls and bulkheads exist only to separate different atmospheres, control hazards, and create distinct social and functional spaces.”

So: no, you don’t need atmosphere walls for containment; the bubble does that.
You do want internal structure for gameplay, ecology, and safety.

Yeah, good catch: if the bubble just lets all EM through, then parking next to an accretion disk or getting caught in a flare would cook everyone. We need a story-consistent answer.

The short version:

Mass can’t cross, light can. But we shape which light.
The Higgs bubble is the pressure hull; radiation shielding is done by a mix of field tuning + passive mass + active systems.

Let’s make that canonical.

⸻

1. What would happen without extra design?

If the bubble were:
	•	perfectly transparent to all photons, from radio → gamma,

then:
	•	hard X-rays, gamma, flare particles, GRB tails, etc. would sail right through,
	•	near a black hole / neutron star / magnetar, your fluxes would be insane,
	•	long-term cancer dose and acute radiation events would be game over.

So yes: you absolutely need protection from high-energy radiation.

⸻

2. Canonical fix: the bubble has energy-dependent transparency

We keep your nice visual transparency, but not as a flat “all EM allowed” rule.

Instead:

Bubble boundary properties:
	•	Fully transparent to:
	•	visible light
	•	near-IR / near-UV (tune as needed for visuals)
	•	Partially suppressed / scattered for:
	•	X-rays
	•	gamma rays
	•	very hard UV
	•	Effectively opaque (or converted) at the really nasty end:
	•	high-energy gamma, cosmic rays → turned into showers of lower-energy photons / pairs that can be absorbed by internal shielding.

In-fiction, you can say:

The Higgs field manipulation changes the local vacuum’s EM response: it has a frequency-dependent refractive index and acts like an “energy-selective membrane”.

So from inside, you still see:
	•	starfields, planets, accretion disks, etc.,
	•	but the truly harsh bands are filtered or “de-bruted”.

From outside, high-energy radiation “sees” a different effective medium and gets:
	•	scattered,
	•	down-converted,
	•	or reflected.

We already said the bubble is refractive — now we just make that energy-dependent and that’s your shield.

⸻

3. Layer 2: passive mass shielding

You still want “boring” radiation shielding, both for realism and gameplay.

Inside the bubble:
	•	Put water tanks, hydrogen-rich plastics, and structure on the outer side of habitable decks.
	•	Use:
	•	water jackets around the agri shell,
	•	fuel tanks,
	•	structural foam,
	•	soil/biomass reservoirs.

This gives you:
	•	good shielding against remaining X-rays and secondary particles,
	•	a reason to have “thick” outer regions that feel massive and protective,
	•	natural “storm shelters” deeper in (engineering decks, inner ring) during extreme events.

Mechanically:
	•	Observation deck = beautiful but “thin” shield → high radiation when field can’t fully filter (e.g. you screwed up and got way too close).
	•	Deep decks = safer, used as storm bunkers (events: solar flare, disk spike, etc.).

⸻

4. Layer 3: active fields

On top of the field + mass, you can have:
	•	magnetic fields shaped around the spire,
	•	plasma “aurora” layer in the upper bubble region,
	•	dynamic EM shielding tuned to external spectrum.

This gives you:
	•	nice visuals (fake “aurora” inside the bubble),
	•	a system you can upgrade as a proto-tech branch:
	•	better GR proximity → closer, more insane vistas,
	•	safer dwell times near high-flux phenomena.

⸻

5. How this plays in-game

Normal cruise / near “quiet” stars
	•	Visible view is almost unfiltered.
	•	Radiation dose is low; you live on the upper decks happily.
	•	Only background shielding is passive mass + standard field tuning.

Near flares / harsh UV stars / O/B stars
	•	Field dynamically shifts:
	•	slight dimming / colour shift,
	•	maybe visible oscillation at the bubble edge,
	•	Archive warns: “High UV/X-ray flux, recommend moving crew to inner decks.”
	•	Observation deck can:
	•	auto-dim,
	•	switch to indirect projected view (internal displays fed by filtered sensors).

Near black holes / accretion disks / neutron stars
	•	Hard radiation is huge; you rely heavily on field + active shielding.
	•	Observation deck shows a stylised, safe rendering (SR/GR effects intact) rather than raw photon counts.
	•	Mechanically:
	•	too close without proper upgrades → long-term dose risk, system failures, narrative consequences.
	•	with upgrades → you unlock “front-row seats” to insane GR events, with minimal physical risk.

⸻

6. Canonical design line for the doc

Something like:

“The Higgs bubble boundary is impermeable to massive particles but selectively transparent to EM radiation.
Visible light and low-energy photons pass almost unimpeded, preserving external views.
High-energy X-rays and gamma rays are scattered, down-converted, or reflected by the modified vacuum at the boundary, then absorbed or further mitigated by internal shielding (water, structure, active magnetic fields).
In practice, crew can enjoy panoramic views while the ship remains protected from lethal radiation in most scenarios.”

That keeps:
	•	your transparency,
	•	your hard-sci tone,
	•	your GR playground,
	•	and gives you hooks for upgrades and events (“radiation storm”, “barely filtered jet”).
